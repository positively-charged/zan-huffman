This library implements the Huffman compression algorithm used by Zandronum.
Zandronum uses the Huffman compression algorithm to compress the traffic that
is sent between a client and a server, including communication between an RCON
client and a server.

This library is a fork of the C++ Huffman library by VortexCortex. In this
fork, the said C++ library is converted to a C codebase; the intention is to
make the functionality of the C++ library be usable by C programs.
